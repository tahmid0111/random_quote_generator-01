This is a really awesome project made with vanilla JavaScript. Actually, I use the DOM( document object model ) and fetch API for load data from another resource and to show it to the users in a eye soothing form. I put comments in every turn in this project, So, if you are a beginner then you will not face any problem to understand the code.
